# Translate .ass or .srt subs

Simple python script to translate .ass or .srt files with gemini api.

## Setup

The program required python to be installed and expects a gemini key in the file gemini.key.

The setup_env.ps1 script can be used to setup the python .venv with the required dependencies, it does nothing more than:

```console
> python -m venv .venv
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup an appropriate prompt.txt to guide the translation.
Gemini and other settings can be configured in config.json

## How to

The translate_subs.py script takes a list of file paths or a folder and generate a translated file for each sub file.

```console
> python ./translate_subs.py ./subs # will translate all .ass in the folder ./subs (files peviously generated by the script are tagged by a suffix and ignored)
> python ./translate_subs.py ./subs/file1.ass ./subs/file2.ass # translate the two files
```

The translate_subs.ps1 will prompt the user with a file browser window to select the files to translate and launch the python script.
